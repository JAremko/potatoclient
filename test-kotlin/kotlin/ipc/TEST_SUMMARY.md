# IPC Test Suite Summary

## Test Coverage

### Test Files and Counts

| File | JUnit Tests | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **IpcClientServerTest.kt** | 14 | ✅ Defined | Full JUnit test suite for client-server communication |
| **IpcManagerTest.kt** | 18 | ⚠️ Cannot compile | Depends on gesture classes not available |
| **MessageBuildersTest.kt** | 18 | ⚠️ Cannot compile | Depends on gesture classes not available |
| **TransitSocketCommunicatorTest.kt** | 9 | ✅ Defined | Tests for Transit socket communication |
| **SimpleIpcTest.kt** | 4 custom | ✅ PASSING | Basic non-blocking tests |
| **ThreadedIpcTest.kt** | 3 custom | ⚠️ 2/3 Pass | Socket timing issues in multi-stream test |
| **Total** | 59 JUnit + 7 custom | - | - |

### Test Execution Results

#### ✅ Fully Passing Tests

**SimpleIpcTest** (4/4 tests passing):
- Testing IpcKeys... PASSED
- Testing Socket Path Generation... PASSED
- Testing Server Creation... PASSED
- Testing Client Creation... PASSED

#### ⚠️ Partially Passing Tests

**ThreadedIpcTest** (2/3 tests passing):
- Testing Basic Message Exchange... PASSED
- Testing Close Request... PASSED
- Testing Multiple Streams... FAILED (socket connection timing issues)

### Test Categories

#### Core Functionality Tests ✅
- IPC key definitions and Transit keyword handling
- Socket path generation with PID + stream name
- Server and client lifecycle management
- Basic message sending/receiving

#### Integration Tests ⚠️
- Multi-threaded socket communication (partially working)
- Multiple concurrent streams (timing issues)

#### Unavailable Tests (Dependencies Missing)
- IpcManagerTest - requires gesture event classes
- MessageBuildersTest - requires gesture event classes

## Summary

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **No skipped/disabled tests** - All defined tests are active
2. **Core IPC functionality** - Keys, socket paths, lifecycle management
3. **Simple communication** - Basic client-server message exchange
4. **Clean separation** - IpcClient and IpcServer properly separated

### ⚠️ Known Issues:
1. **Socket timing** - Multi-stream tests have race conditions
2. **Missing dependencies** - IpcManager and MessageBuilders need gesture classes
3. **Thread cleanup** - Some interrupted thread exceptions in tests

### Test Commands

Run simple passing tests:
```bash
./scripts/run-ipc-tests.sh
```

Run all tests (including ones with issues):
```bash
./scripts/run-all-ipc-tests.sh
```

### Recommendations

1. The core IPC functionality is solid and tested
2. Multi-threaded socket tests need better synchronization
3. IpcManager/MessageBuilders tests need their dependencies resolved
4. Consider using mock sockets for more reliable integration tests
