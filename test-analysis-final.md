# Final Test Analysis After Fixes

## Summary
- Total tests run: 116
- Total assertions: 3549  
- Failures: 11 (reduced from 59)
- Errors: 33 (reduced from 40)

## Improvements Made
1. Fixed mock WebSocket managers to return boolean from sendCommand
2. Fixed mock WebSocket managers to implement isConnected method
3. Updated stubbed tests to work correctly
4. Disabled tests that depend on deleted WebSocket server classes

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Generator Test Failures (generator_test.clj)
- test-frozen-command - Still not capturing commands
- test-ping-command - Still not capturing commands  
- test-noop-command - Still not capturing commands

### 2. Validation Test Failures (validation_safety_test.clj)
- command-functions-validate-inputs - Multiple failures related to command validation

### 3. Proto Validation Runtime Test (proto_validation_runtime_test.clj)
- test-validation-performance - Performance test failing

### 4. WebSocket Integration Test (websocket_integration_test.clj)
- test-command-sending - Commands returning true instead of nil

### 5. Errors (33 total)
Most errors appear to be related to:
- Reflection issues (Reflector.java)
- JSON formatting issues (JsonFormat.java)
- Command structure validation errors

## Root Causes
1. Some command functions are returning true (from sendCommand) instead of nil
2. Generator tests may have additional issues with command capture
3. Validation tests may be encountering protobuf-related reflection issues

## Files Successfully Using Stubs
- websocket_stubbed_test.clj - All 6 tests passing
- websocket_simple_connection_test.clj - All tests passing with stubs

## Next Steps
To fully resolve remaining issues:
1. Fix command functions to ensure they return nil
2. Debug generator test command capture mechanism
3. Investigate protobuf reflection/validation errors
4. Update or disable remaining integration tests that expect real servers
