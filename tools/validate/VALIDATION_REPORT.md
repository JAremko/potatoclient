# TODO.md Validation Report

## Validation Date: 2025-08-09

## Summary
Validated completion status of checked items in TODO.md for the Validate Tool project.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ VALIDATED

### Checked Items Status:
- ‚úÖ **Research Malli documentation** - VALIDATED: deps.edn includes Malli dependency
- ‚úÖ **Explore existing shared specs** - VALIDATED: Symlinks to shared specs are properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Set up symlinks** - VALIDATED: All symlinks exist and point to correct locations:
  - `src/validate/specs/shared` ‚Üí `../../../../shared/src/potatoclient/specs`
  - `src/validate/specs/cmd` ‚Üí `../../../../../shared/src/potatoclient/specs/cmd`
  - `src/validate/specs/state` ‚Üí `../../../../../shared/src/potatoclient/specs/state`
- ‚úÖ **Create directory structure** - VALIDATED: Core directory structure exists
  - `src/validate/` directory exists
  - `src/validate/specs/` with proper symlinks
  - `test/validate/specs/` directory exists
- ‚úÖ **Initialize global Malli registry** - VALIDATED: Registry initialization code found in:
  - `test/validate/specs/oneof_edn_test.clj`
  - `test/validate/specs/state_test.clj`
  - `src/validate/examples.clj`

### Missing Components from Phase 1:
- ‚ùå `src/validate/generators/` directory not created
- ‚ùå `src/validate/buff/` directory not created
- ‚ùå `src/validate/property/` directory not created
- ‚ùå `test/validate/property/` directory not created
- ‚ùå `test/validate/generators/` directory not created

## Phase 2: Proto Discovery and Analysis ‚úÖ PARTIALLY VALIDATED

### Checked Items Status:
- ‚úÖ **State proto structure documented** - VALIDATED: TODO.md contains detailed field information
- ‚úÖ **buf.validate constraints documented** - VALIDATED: Constraints listed in TODO.md
- ‚úÖ **Java class name mapping** - VALIDATED: Class names documented (JonSharedData$JonGUIState)
- ‚úÖ **Nested message types identified** - VALIDATED: 14 nested messages listed
- ‚úÖ **Cmd proto structure documented** - VALIDATED: Complete field hierarchy documented
- ‚úÖ **Command constraints documented** - VALIDATED: All constraints listed including oneof structure

### Missing Components from Phase 2:
- ‚ùå No separate reference document created (constraints only in TODO.md)
- ‚ùå Proto discovery outputs not saved in structured format

## Phase 3: Shared Base Specs Development üîß NOT STARTED
- All items remain unchecked and pending

## Validation Results

### Fully Completed Phases:
- **None** - Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 have missing components

### Partially Completed Phases:
1. **Phase 1 (Foundation Setup)**: ~70% complete
   - Core structure exists but specialized directories missing
2. **Phase 2 (Proto Discovery)**: ~85% complete  
   - Documentation exists but not in separate reference files

### Recommendations:
1. **Complete Phase 1**: Create missing directories for generators, buff integration, and property testing
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Create structured reference documents from proto discovery
3. **Begin Phase 3**: Start implementing shared base specs with buf.validate constraints

## Files Verified:
- `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/tools/validate/TODO.md`
- `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/tools/validate/src/validate/` (directory structure)
- `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/tools/validate/test/validate/` (test structure)
- `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/tools/validate/README.md` (project documentation)
- Symlink targets in shared specs directory

## Conclusion:
The checked items in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are **mostly accurate** but both phases have **incomplete components** that prevent them from being considered fully complete. The project has made good progress on foundation and discovery but needs additional work to fully complete these phases before moving to implementation phases.
