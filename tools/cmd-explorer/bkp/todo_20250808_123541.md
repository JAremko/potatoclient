# CMD-Explorer Implementation Plan

## Preamble - Implementation Strategy and Guidelines

### Overview
CMD-Explorer is a comprehensive testing and validation tool for WebSocket command endpoints. It implements all TypeScript cmd functions with full protobuf validation, generative testing, and buf.validate constraint enforcement.

### Architecture Overview

The tool will use a multimethod-based dispatch system for sending commands, where:
1. Each command function accepts a payload map and constructs the appropriate protobuf message
2. A central dispatcher routes commands based on the payload type (oneof field)
3. All functions are guardrails-protected with Malli specs
4. Validation happens at multiple levels: Malli specs, buf.validate constraints, and protobuf parsing

### Key Technologies and References

#### Proto-Explorer Usage (CRITICAL TOOL)

**Proto-Explorer is MANDATORY for understanding message structures and constraints.**

Every function implementation MUST start with proto-explorer to:
1. Understand exact message structure
2. Discover buf.validate constraints
3. Identify required vs optional fields
4. Understand nested message relationships
5. Find enum values and their constraints

```bash
cd /tools/proto-explorer

# List all cmd message types
./proto-explorer cmd

# Show Root message structure with validation rules  
./proto-explorer cmd Root

# Show specific command structure
./proto-explorer cmd DayCamera.Root
./proto-explorer cmd DayCamera.Zoom

# Always explore nested messages
./proto-explorer cmd RotaryPlatform.Axis
./proto-explorer cmd RotaryPlatform.Azimuth
```

**Never implement a function without first exploring its protobuf structure!**

#### Pronto Documentation
- Main docs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAremko/pronto/refs/heads/master/README.md
- Performance: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAremko/pronto/refs/heads/master/doc/performance.md
- Key features: Automatic EDN<->Protobuf conversion, validation support, nested message handling

#### Guardrails with Malli
- Documentation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fulcrologic/guardrails/refs/heads/main/README.adoc
- Use `com.fulcrologic.guardrails.malli` namespace for Malli integration
- Every function must have >? and <? annotations for input/output validation

#### Buf.validate Constraints
Java protobuf classes contain validation annotations that we must respect:
- Field constraints (min/max values, string patterns, required fields)
- Oneof constraints (exactly one field must be set)
- Custom CEL expressions for complex validation

### TypeScript Reference Implementation
Location: `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/examples/web/frontend/ts/cmd/`

Key files with command bindings to implement:
- `cmdSender/cmdDayCamera.ts` - Day camera commands (29 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdHeatCamera.ts` - Heat camera commands (31 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdRotary.ts` - Rotary platform commands (40 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdLRF.ts` - Laser rangefinder commands (14 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdCompass.ts` - Compass commands (11 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdGps.ts` - GPS commands (5 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdSystem.ts` - System commands (11 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdOSD.ts` - OSD commands (8 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdCamDayGlassHeater.ts` - Glass heater commands (5 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdCV.ts` - Computer vision commands (8 functions)
- `cmdSender/cmdLRFAlignment.ts` - LRF alignment commands (10 functions)

Note: `cmdSenderShared.ts` contains TypeScript-specific infrastructure (message creation, encoding, WebSocket handling) that will be replaced by our Clojure implementation using Pronto and our WebSocket client.

### Spec-Driven Development with Guardrails

**Key Design Decision**: Unlike TypeScript functions that return void and send messages as side effects, our Clojure functions will:
1. Return the complete CMD protobuf tree as EDN (using Pronto format)
2. Enable testing without side effects
3. Allow inspection and validation of generated messages
4. Separate message construction from sending

**Guardrails Integration**:
- Every function will have a preceding `def` with Malli specs
- Custom generators attached to specs for property-based testing
- Guardrails instrumentation enabled during tool operation
- Direct testing of guardrailed functions with generated inputs

Example structure:
```clojure
;; Spec definition with custom generator
(def day-camera-zoom-spec
  [:map 
   [:value [:double {:min 0.0 :max 1.0 
                    :gen/gen (gen/double* {:min 0.0 :max 1.0})}]]])

;; Guardrailed function
(>defn day-camera-set-zoom
  [zoom-value]
  [day-camera-zoom-spec => cmd-root-spec]  ; Returns full CMD tree
  {:protocolVersion 1
   :dayCamera {:zoom {:value zoom-value}}})
```

**Shared Specs Directory**:
Create `src/cmd_explorer/specs/shared.clj` for reusable specs:
- Angle specs (azimuth, elevation, bank)
- Range specs (0-1 normalized values)
- Position specs (lat/lon/alt)
- Common enums (localization, modes)
- Full CMD root spec with oneof validation

**Return Value Spec**:
All functions return a complete CMD root message as EDN:
- Must validate against `cmd-root-spec` (using custom oneof spec)
- Exactly one payload field populated
- All required fields present
- Ready for Pronto serialization

### Implementation Flow

1. **Pre-Implementation Research (MANDATORY for EVERY function)**
   - **Read TypeScript source**: Examine the exact implementation in `/examples/web/frontend/ts/cmd/`
   - **Use proto-explorer**: Run `./proto-explorer cmd <MessageType>` to understand:
     - Message structure and field types
     - Nested message requirements
     - Buf.validate constraints on each field
     - Oneof groups and required fields
   - **Document findings**: Note any special constraints or business logic
   
   Example workflow:
   ```bash
   # For implementing day-camera-set-zoom
   1. Read: /examples/web/frontend/ts/cmd/cmdSender/cmdDayCamera.ts:99
   2. Explore: ./proto-explorer cmd DayCamera.Root
   3. Explore: ./proto-explorer cmd DayCamera.Zoom
   4. Note: zoom value constraint is [0.0, 1.0] from buf.validate
   ```

2. **Function Implementation**
   - Define Malli spec with custom generators based on proto constraints
   - Create guardrailed function with >defn
   - Add >? input spec and <? output spec annotations
   - Return complete CMD protobuf tree as EDN matching proto structure
   - No side effects in command construction

3. **Testing Strategy (for EVERY function)**
   - Exercise guardrailed function directly with generated inputs
   - Simple value tests (positive cases)
   - Negative tests (invalid inputs)
   - Boundary tests (min/max values from buf.validate discovered via proto-explorer)
   - Generative tests (minimum 300 runs using spec generators)
   - Validate returned EDN structure matches proto definition

3. **Validation Layers**
   - Input validation via Malli specs
   - Buf.validate constraint checking
   - Protobuf serialization validation
   - Mock WebSocket response validation

4. **Multimethod Dispatch**
   - Dispatch on payload type (oneof field name)
   - Each method constructs appropriate nested message
   - Central send-command function handles common fields

### Custom Oneof Spec
Copy and adapt `/home/jare/git/potatoclient/src/potatoclient/specs/malli_oneof.clj`:
- Rename to `oneof_payload.clj`
- Ensure only one field is populated in oneof messages
- Generate valid oneof values for testing
- Integrate with Pronto's message generation

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **Mock WebSocket Server**
   - Receives binary protobuf messages
   - Deserializes and validates using buf.validate
   - Returns success/error responses
   - Logs all received commands for verification

2. **Generative Testing Requirements**
   - Custom generators respecting buf.validate annotations
   - Minimum 300 test runs per function
   - Property: "valid inputs always produce valid protobuf"
   - Property: "invalid inputs always fail validation"

3. **Validation Checkpoints**
   - Pre-send: Malli spec validation
   - Serialization: Protobuf encoding success
   - Buf.validate: Constraint satisfaction
   - Mock response: Server acceptance
