# Seesaw Binding Cleanup Summary

## Overview
All seesaw bindings in the codebase are now automatically cleaned up using a single function that scans for seesaw's predictable watcher patterns.

## Implementation

### Core Function: `state/cleanup-seesaw-bindings!`
Located in `src/potatoclient/state.clj`, this function:
- Scans `state/app-state` for watchers with keys matching seesaw's pattern
- Removes all watchers created by `seesaw.bind/bind`
- Pattern detected: `:bindable-atom-watcherXXXXX` (where XXXXX is a gensym number)

### Binding Usage in Codebase

1. **menu_bar.clj** (1 binding)
   - Stream toggle buttons bound to process status
   - Cleaned up on: Frame reload, window close

2. **control_panel.clj** (3 bindings)
   - Stream status panels bound to process state
   - Connection info panel bound to connection URL
   - Stream toggle buttons bound to process status
   - Cleaned up on: Frame reload, window close

### Cleanup Triggers

1. **Window Close** (`main_frame.clj`)
   - Calls `state/cleanup-seesaw-bindings!` 
   - Removes ALL seesaw bindings before shutdown

2. **Frame Reload** (`menu_bar.clj`)
   - Called when theme or locale changes
   - Calls `state/cleanup-seesaw-bindings!`
   - Ensures no stale bindings remain after UI recreation

### Benefits

- **No manual tracking** - Bindings don't need to be registered
- **No memory leaks** - All bindings automatically cleaned up
- **Simple usage** - Just use `bind/bind` normally
- **Centralized cleanup** - One function handles everything

### Testing

Comprehensive tests in:
- `test/potatoclient/state_test.clj` - Tests cleanup mechanism
- `test/potatoclient/ui/menu_bar_test.clj` - Tests UI integration

Tests verify:
- Watchers are properly removed
- Bindings stop triggering after cleanup
- Non-seesaw watchers are preserved
- Expected naming pattern is detected

## Key Insight

By understanding that seesaw's `Bindable` protocol implementation uses `gensym` to create predictable watcher keys, we can scan and remove them without tracking individual binding objects. This makes the code much simpler and more maintainable.
