# TODO: Documentation Verification Pass

This is a second-pass verification to ensure our documentation restructuring was complete and accurate.

## Phase 1: Verify Documentation Coverage ✓ COMPLETED

- [x] **Verify all source files have been considered**
  - [x] Check all `.clj` files for inline documentation that should be extracted
  - [x] Check all `.kt` files for important implementation details
  - [x] Check `resources/` for configuration files that need documentation
  - [x] Check `scripts/` for any tools or utilities needing docs

- [x] **Verify all tools are documented**
  - [x] Check `tools/` directory for any undocumented tools
  - [x] Verify proto-explorer documentation is complete
  - [x] Verify mock-video-stream documentation is complete  
  - [x] Verify guardrails-check documentation is complete
  - [x] Check for any Babashka scripts needing documentation

- [x] **Verify build system documentation**
  - [x] Check Makefile for any undocumented targets
  - [x] Verify deps.edn aliases are documented
  - [x] Check for any build scripts in `scripts/`
  - [x] Verify CI/CD setup is documented

**Phase 1 Findings**: See DOCUMENTATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md for detailed results

## Phase 2: Cross-Reference and Accuracy ✓ COMPLETED

- [x] **Verify all cross-references work**
  - [x] Check all internal links in documentation
  - [x] Verify file paths in examples are correct
  - [x] Check that code examples actually work

  - [x] Verify all protobuf commands listed are implemented
  - [x] Check that Transit protocol examples are current
  - [x] Verify video stream specifications (resolution, FPS)

- [x] **Check for outdated information**
  - [x] Search for version numbers that might be outdated
  - [x] Look for references to removed features
  - [x] Check for old TODO items in code comments
  - [x] Verify all external links still work

**Phase 2 Findings**: See DOCUMENTATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md for detailed results

## Phase 3: Completeness Check ✓ COMPLETED

- [x] **Verify nothing was lost in migration**
  - [x] Compare old .claude/ content with new docs/ content
  - [x] Check that all important details were preserved
  - [x] Verify no unique information was accidentally dropped
  - [x] Ensure all code examples were migrated

- [x] **Check for missing documentation**
  - [x] Document any configuration files in resources/
  - [x] Document any important scripts
  - [x] Check for undocumented public APIs
  - [x] Verify all user-facing features are documented

- [x] **Verify consistency**
  - [x] Check that terminology is consistent across docs
  - [x] Verify formatting is consistent
  - [x] Check that examples follow same patterns
  - [x] Ensure all docs have proper headers/footers

**Phase 3 Findings**: See DOCUMENTATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md for detailed results

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

- [ ] **Test all documented procedures**
  - [ ] Test getting started guide from scratch
  - [ ] Test adding a new language following the guide
  - [ ] Test adding a new theme following the guide
  - [ ] Test debugging subprocess following the guide

- [ ] **Verify tool documentation**
  - [ ] Run all proto-explorer examples
  - [ ] Test mock-video-stream scenarios
  - [ ] Run guardrails-check and verify output

- [ ] **Check build documentation**
  - [ ] Verify all make targets work as documented
  - [ ] Test release build process
  - [ ] Verify platform-specific builds

## Phase 5: Final Review

- [ ] **Review main entry points**
  - [ ] README.md - clear and welcoming?
  - [ ] CLAUDE.md - comprehensive for AI context?
  - [ ] docs/README.md - good navigation?
  - [ ] Getting started guide - smooth onboarding?

- [ ] **Check for clarity**
  - [ ] Are complex concepts well explained?
  - [ ] Are there enough examples?
  - [ ] Is the navigation intuitive?
  - [ ] Are error scenarios covered?

- [ ] **Verify principles are captured**
  - [ ] "No legacy support" principle clear?
  - [ ] "Clean architecture" explained?
  - [ ] "Keywords everywhere" documented?
  - [ ] Performance considerations noted?

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Archive

- [ ] **Final cleanup tasks**
  - [ ] Remove any temporary verification files
  - [ ] Delete any backup copies made during migration
  - [ ] Clean up any test artifacts
  - [ ] Update .gitignore if needed

- [ ] **Create final summary**
  - [ ] Document what was found and fixed
  - [ ] Note any remaining concerns
  - [ ] Create changelog of documentation updates
  - [ ] Update documentation version/date

- [ ] **Archive this TODO**
  - [ ] Move this file to docs/archive/
  - [ ] Mark completion date
  - [ ] Add summary of findings
  - [ ] Close any related issues

## Notes

- Focus on accuracy over perfection
- Document any findings in a summary file
- If new issues are found, create separate TODOs
- Remember: we don't care about legacy/versioning

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] Summary document created
- [ ] Any new TODOs created for findings
- [ ] This TODO moved to archive
- [ ] Team notified of completion
